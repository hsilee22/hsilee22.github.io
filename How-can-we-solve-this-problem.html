	Polar bears can be discovered in the circumpolar Arctic along or near the coastal regions and on islands. However, they spend most of their life on the sea ice. Sea ice is very important to polar bears because It offers a stage for polar bears to hunt, live, breed, and even to create maternal location. In addition, the sea ice also provides polar bears with rich food supplies, such as sea seals, which are the main diet for polar bears..The sea ice offers many different kinds of microorganism and other food sources. This creates the Arctic marine ecosystem. When the polar bears are not on the ice, they are finding food for most of time. Polar bear spend most of their time on fishing and sleeping.

	Characteristics of the habitat : 
	The Arctic is almost entirely covered by frozen water, such as glaciers and icebergs, which are frozen freshwater. Actually, the glaciers and icebergs in the Arctic make up about 20% of Earth's supply of freshwater. Sea ice helps determine Earth's climate. They can measure the severity of global warming by how much the sea level rising and how much the ice melt.

		Predators : Polar bears have no natural predators, except for other polar bears. Their biggest predator is human. Human will kill them because we need their fur or even their meat.
