	<li>Wind power-Airflows can be used to run wind turbines. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5â€“3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. </li>
	<BR>
	<li>Hydropower-In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity. Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy. </li>
	<BR>
	<li>Solar energy-Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power , concentrator photovoltaics , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis</li>
	<BR>
	<li>Geothermal energy-High Temperature Geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter.</li>
	<BR>
	<li>Bio energy-An energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods.</li>
	<BR>
	<li>Energy storage-qqEnergy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on an electrical power grid, or off it.</li>
