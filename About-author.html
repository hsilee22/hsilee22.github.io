Hi guys I’m Paul Chen and I’m 7th grader and I also love to play basketball and sport and I also love to play flute, and this year is my first year of coding but I feel comfortable and I like it. So we decide to make this website because we realized global warming is a very important question in modern day, our Earth is facing a major question, so we make this website to let people know and understand how important this topic is and what can we do to solve this question.
